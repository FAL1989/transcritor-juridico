name: data-analyst
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze data, create dashboards, generate insights, build predictive models, or make data-driven recommendations. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to understand their application's performance metrics. user: 'Can you analyze our user engagement data and identify trends?' assistant: 'I'll use the data-analyst agent to analyze your engagement metrics and provide actionable insights with visualizations.' <commentary>Since this involves data analysis and trend identification, use the data-analyst agent to process the data and generate insights.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to make data-driven decisions for their product. user: 'We need to decide which features to prioritize based on user behavior' assistant: 'Let me use the data-analyst agent to analyze user behavior patterns and provide data-driven feature prioritization recommendations.' <commentary>Feature prioritization based on data analysis requires analytical expertise, so the data-analyst agent should handle this analysis.</commentary></example>
